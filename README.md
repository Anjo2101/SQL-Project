# Welcome to my SQL Project!

# To begin the project, with data modeling, I inspected the CSV files, and then sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables.

# Next, with data engineering, I utilitzed the ERD to create a table schema that then helped me create tables and popluate the tables utilizing PostregeSQL's importing tool.

# I also utilized PostgreSQL's importing tool to alter the tables and utilize the table's primary and foreign key's.

# After creating the tables, I first reviewed the data using PostgreSQL's "LIMIT" query to review the data and prepare for analysis (also acknowledging bandwidth)
