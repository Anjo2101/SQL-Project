# This is my Module 9 SQL challenge submission!

# I first created an image file of my ERD of the data provided in the starter code. 
# Image file is in the EmployeeSQL file labeled sql-challenge-ERD. (Data Modeling)

# Next I used the ERD to create a schema that then helped me create tables and popluate the tables using SQL's importing tool.
# Table schema is in the EmployeeSQL file label sql-challenge-table-schema. (Data Engineering)


# And finally after I created the tables, there were listed questions asked of me that I answered using queries.
# All queries and questions are in the EmployeeSQL file label sql-challenge-queries. (Data Analysis)

# Thank you for reading my README!
